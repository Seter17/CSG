HOW TO USE DESCRIPTION
========================

This is implementation of CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) technique, described by Laidlaw and Trumbore.
While folder contains 3 part. 

1. CSG project.
    Project where was implemented whole CSG necessary datatypes and algorithms to perform bollean operations.

2. CPP Unit test
    Project for testing CSG operation and its parts. Besides code - it includes 3 folders.
        "Input" - folder that contains several cases of input geometry
        "Output" - fodler where operations output will take place
        "Standard" - folder where can be found expected results on "unchanged" input data with implemented tests. Exists for comparing and testing.

3. Test viewer
    Test application for visualization of input and output data from Test Project.
    Application need jre7 to be installed and can be launche by clicking on Viewer.jar or launch.bat. 
    It is possible that j3dcore-ogl.dll should be copied to Windows folder.
